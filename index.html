        <h3 class="content-title">COLOR TRENDS</h3>

        <p>Color is always what captures attention the most. They're playing a very important part this Paris Fashion Week, even though they may seem subtler in brightness than the previous fashion weeks... For example, pastel colors dominated most of George Hobeika and Tony Ward's collections, while Ralph & Russo and Georges Chakra's runway witnessed a huge diversity between pastels, bright and dark colors as well. Metallics were present in most looks at Dior.</p>

        <h3 class="content-title">SATIN FINISH</h3>

        <p>We saw it dominate the SAG Awards red carpet and it continues to gain a lot of popularity. The glistening fabric looks beautiful and catches the light on luxurious evening gowns. A lot of the designers chose the fabric for their designs, from a glossy or matte to light and thicker fabrics of satin.</p>

        <h3 class="content-title">MULTILAYERS</h3>

        <p>Ruffles and ripples are a smart way to add volume and luxury to a dress. The use of ruffles and multiple layers in a dress has been very popular especially for red carpet looks. There were also some gorgeous metallic fringes at Dior. There's something for everyone.

        <h3 class="content-title">CAPES</h3>
        <p>The cape trend was really prominent for this fall and winter. It's still continuing its journey to spring and summer. We saw capes at Ralph & Russo, George Hobeika and Dior during this Haute Couture Fashion Week in Paris. We think this trend is going to be with us for a while...</p>
